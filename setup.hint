sdesc: "GNOME chess client"
ldesc: "This is gnome-chess, a graphical user interface for playing chess.

It works with chess programs and chess servers - it is also a PGN viewer.
For chess programs, it works best with the chess engine crafty
(ftp.cis.uab.edu/pub/hyatt) but most features should also work with
GNU Chess (ftp.gnu.org)."
